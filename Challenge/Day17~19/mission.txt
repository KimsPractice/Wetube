Mongoose Time!

Challenge

Using Mongoose, create a CRUD (Create, Read, Delete, Update) Application for Movies.
The routes you have to make are:

/ <-- See all Movies
/create <-- Create a movie (html form)
/:id <-- See movie by id
/:id/edit <-- Edit movie by ID
/:id/delete <-- Delete movie by ID
/search <-- Search movies

On the line 12 of models/Movie.js you have to create a complete schema for your movie model.
The schema should have the fields id. title, year, rating, sysnopsis, genre[], uploadedAt.
All the fields are required.
You need to validate that the year is a number.
You need to validate that the title is al least 3 characters long.
When I create a movie I should be redirected to the detail page of that movie.
When a moive is not found I should see a 404
When I delete a movie I should be redirected to the home page.
On the /search page I should be able to filter by /search?year=1900 or /search?ration=9.6
