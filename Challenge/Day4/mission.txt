Challenge goals:

Make 4 routes: "/" , "/about-us" , "/contact" and "/protected"
Each route should render a string with the name of the page, i.e: "/about-us" -> About Us.
Make one middleware for all the routes, that middleware should console.log the message "I'm a middleware" on every request to any route.
Make a middleware that won't allow me to go to "/protected", if I try to go to "/protected" I should be redirected back to "/"
